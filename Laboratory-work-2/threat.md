|1|web-app-request|Spoofing|Spoofing the Browser Client Process|Spoofing is when a process or entity is something other than its claimed identity. Examples include substituting a process, a file, website or a network address.|Browser Client may be spoofed by an attacker and this may lead to unauthorized access to React.js App. Consider using a standard authentication mechanism to identify the source process.|
|2|web-app-request|Spoofing|Spoofing the React.js App Process|Spoofing is when a process or entity is something other than its claimed identity. Examples include substituting a process, a file, website or a network address.|React.js App may be spoofed by an attacker and this may lead to information disclosure by Browser Client. Consider using a standard authentication mechanism to identify the destination process.|
|3|web-app-request|Tampering|Potential Lack of Input Validation for React.js App|Tampering is the act of altering the bits. Tampering with a process involves changing bits in the running process. Similarly, Tampering with a data flow involves changing bits on the wire or between two running processes.|Data flowing across web-app-request may be tampered with by an attacker. This may lead to a denial of service attack against React.js App or an elevation of privilege attack against React.js App or an information disclosure by React.js App. Failure to verify that input is as expected is a root cause of a very large number of exploitable issues. Consider all paths and the way they handle data. Verify that all input is verified for correctness using an approved list input validation approach.|
|4|web-app-request|Tampering|Browser Client Process Memory Tampered|If Browser Client is given access to memory, such as shared memory or pointers, or is given the ability to control what React.js App executes (for example, passing back a function pointer.), then Browser Client can tamper with React.js App. Consider if the function could work with less access to memory, such as passing data rather than pointers. Copy in data provided, and then validate it.|
|5|web-app-request|Tampering|Cross Site Scripting|Tampering is the act of altering the bits. Tampering with a process involves changing bits in the running process. Similarly, Tampering with a data flow involves changing bits on the wire or between two running processes.|
|6|web-app-request|Repudiation|Potential Data Repudiation by React.js App|React.js App claims that it did not receive data from a source outside the trust boundary. Consider using logging or auditing to record the source, time, and summary of the received data.|
|7|web-app-request|Information Disclosure|Data Flow Sniffing|Data flowing across web-app-request may be sniffed by an attacker. Depending on what type of data an attacker can read, it may be used to attack other parts of the system or simply be a disclosure of information leading to compliance violations. Consider encrypting the data flow.|
|8|web-app-request|Denial Of Service|Potential Process Crash or Stop for React.js App|Denial of Service happens when the process or a datastore is not able to service incoming requests or perform up to spec.|
|9|web-app-request|Denial Of Service|Data Flow Generic Data Flow Is Potentially Interrupted|Denial of Service happens when the process or a datastore is not able to service incoming requests or perform up to spec.|
|10|web-app-request|Elevation Of Privilege|Elevation Using Impersonation|A user subject gains increased capability or privilege by taking advantage of an implementation bug.|
|11|web-app-request|Elevation Of Privilege|React.js App May be Subject to Elevation of Privilege Using Remote Code Execution|A user subject gains increased capability or privilege by taking advantage of an implementation bug.|
|12|web-app-request|Elevation Of Privilege|Elevation by Changing the Execution Flow in React.js App|An attacker may pass data into React.js App in order to change the flow of program execution within React.js App to the attacker's choosing.|
|13|web-app-request|Elevation Of Privilege|Cross Site Request Forgery|Cross-site request forgery (CSRF or XSRF) is a type of attack in which an attacker forces a user's browser to make a forged request to a vulnerable site by exploiting an existing trust relationship between the browser and the vulnerable web site.  In a simple scenario, a user is logged in to web site A using a cookie as a credential.  The other browses to web site B.  Web site B returns a page with a hidden form that posts to web site A.  Since the browser will carry the user's cookie to web site A, web site B now can take any action on web site A, for example, adding an admin to an account.  The attack can be used to exploit any requests that the browser automatically authenticates, e.g. by session cookie, integrated authentication, IP whitelisting, …  The attack can be carried out in many ways such as by luring the victim to a site under control of the attacker, getting the user to click a link in a phishing email, or hacking a reputable web site that the victim will visit. The issue can only be resolved on the server side by requiring that all authenticated state-changing requests include an additional piece of secret payload (canary or CSRF token) which is known only to the legitimate web site and the browser and which is protected in transit through SSL/TLS. See the Forgery Protection property on the flow stencil for a list of mitigations.|

|16|web-app-response|Tampering|Potential Lack of Input Validation for Browser Client|Data flowing across web-app-response may be tampered with by an attacker.
